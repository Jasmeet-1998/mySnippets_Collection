# Major Building Blocks-

* NASA API (Sources/Docs/Info->https://api.nasa.gov/)

  ****NOTE**** if your are developing a production level API or software u can request for the API key and then use in the request.

  In this App I used EONET nasa API this is the documentation https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v2.1

* REACT (create-react-app )

# Additional Packages Used

* google-map-react (to use google maps)
* @iconify/react   (to display fire icons on the map)
* @iconify/icons-mdi (material design)

# How to make it work !!

- Need an api key from the GCP console for google map

  ****follow this =>**** https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

- API endpoint we are hitting in this project
https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v2.1/events

- Clone the repo in your machine.

- npm install in the terminal

- in the root of this project folder create a .env file that contains =>
 ****API_KEY=Your Google maps API key goes here****

- replace Your google maps API key with your API key that u created in the GCP console.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
